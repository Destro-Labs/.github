## Our client work

**[Azure Coffee Roasters](https://www.azurecoffeeroasters.com)**  
We transformed Azure's online presence with a new website featuring a wholesale section, subscription options, and smooth integration with their Square POS system. This upgraded platform showcases their passion for quality coffee while providing a simplified, enjoyable experience for customers.

**[Misc Coffee](https://misc.coffee)**  
Unlike Azure, Misc Coffee was focused on online ordering. We assisted in giving them a clean and simple layout that would help (not confuse) customers order on the go. Go check them out in the heart of Palos Verdes!

**[Hodinkee](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hodinkee/id1008305274)**  
Through strategic partnerships and in-app features, we helped Hodinkee monetize untapped spaces and increase revenue. Additionally, our proactive integration of native iOS features, such as Widgets, Siri Shortcuts, and Dark Mode, ensured that the Hodinkee app remained a top choice for iOS users in the competitive world of luxury watch media.
